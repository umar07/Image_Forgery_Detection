#Image forgery detection based on statistical features of block dct coefficients

This repo contains the code implementation of the above paper by Shilpa et al. [Link to original paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920310048). The dataset used are CASIA 1.0 and CASIA 2.0 . The CSV files containing extracted features were too big too push here. You can run the code to get them yourself or ask me here - [EMAIL](mailto:um71000@gmail.com?subject=Request%20for%20features%20CSV%20files)
