#A passive blind approach for image splicing detection based on dwt and lbp histograms

This repo contains the code implementation of the above paper by Mandeep et al.  [Link to original paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-2738-3_27). The dataset used are CASIA 1.0, CASIA 2.0, Columbia Uncompressed, and Columbia Colored. CSV file for **CASIA 2.0** containing extracted features was too big too push here. You can run the code to get it yourself or ask me here - [EMAIL](mailto:um71000@gmail.com?subject=Request%20for%20features%20CSV%20files)
